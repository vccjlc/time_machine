## About the App

**Time Machine** is an interactive application that brings historical and modern icons together in thought-provoking or hilarious conversations. The app randomly selects two famous individuals from a pool of 67 legendary figures across diverse fields such as science, politics, sports, and entertainment, and places them in a unique setting to discuss an intriguing topic.

The topics range from fun facts and philosophical debates to hypothetical "would-you-rather" questions and even contests like arm-wrestling matches or rap battles. The dialogue is styled to reflect the personalities of the chosen figures, making every encounter as entertaining as it is insightful.

The conversation starts with a mysterious user summoning God, who chooses the topic and participants. A Host facilitates the discussion, guiding the Arguers (two participants) as they present their arguments, while a Judge delivers the verdict, declaring the winner of the short debate.

### Highlights:
- **Dynamic Avatars**: Each character is represented with a distinct avatar for a visually engaging experience.
- **Over 2,211 Possible Encounters**: With 67 famous figures, there are \( \binom{67}{2} = 2211 \) unique combinations of participants, ensuring endless variety.
- **Exciting Topics**: From paradoxes to conspiracy theories, no two conversations are alike.
