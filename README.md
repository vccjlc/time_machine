## About the App

**Time Machine** is an interactive application that brings historical and modern icons together in thought-provoking or amusing conversations. The app randomly selects two famous individuals from a pool of 67 legendary figures across diverse fields such as science, politics, sports, and entertainment, and places them in a unique setting to discuss an intriguing topic.

The topics range from fun facts and philosophical debates to hypothetical "would-you-rather" questions. The dialogue is styled to reflect the personalities of the chosen figures, making every encounter as entertaining as it is insightful.

The conversation begins with the initiator agent invoking God, who selects the topic and participants. A Host then clarifies the topic, introduces the two participants, and prompts them to present their arguments. Finally, the Host evaluates the discussion and may optionally declare a winner of the short debate.

### Highlights:
- **Dynamic Avatars**: Each character is represented with a distinct avatar for a visually engaging experience.
- **Over 2,211 Possible Encounters**: With 67 famous figures, there are 2211 unique combinations of participants, ensuring endless variety.
- **Topics**: From paradoxes to conspiracy theories, no two conversations are alike.
- **Conversation Flavor**: God decides the toneâ€”witty, serious, competitive, or moderateâ€”keeping each interaction unique. 

### Design Principles
- Simplicity
- Different conversation flavors and topics selected randomly together with arguers
- Short debates
